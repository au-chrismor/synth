# Synth - Text to Speech for Windows

This is really simple, but I don't know why there isn't even a basic TTS tool in Windows.  Using Visual Studio Community, you can build this very quickly and easily.

Anything on the command-line gets treated as a text to be read out.  There is nothing more to it than this.

Tested on Windows 10 (17682), but I don't see why it won't work on Windows 7 or 8 as well.

Enjoy!
